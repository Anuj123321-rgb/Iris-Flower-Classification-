#Iris Flower Classification
The Iris Flower Classification project involves building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a simple yet powerful supervised classification method.
